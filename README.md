# Kratin-Care-Prototype-Assignment
Let me introduce you to the `Healthy Aging Hub`, a web application that I've personally crafted with great care. I've used the power of technologies like `HTML`, `CSS`, `Bootstrap`, and `JavaScript` to create something special for our elderly population.

My main goal was to make it user-friendly, especially for seniors. The interface is designed with a lot of thought and heart. I've chosen images that are not only clear but also easy to understand. This way, our elderly users can effortlessly book appointments and store their important information. It's all about making their lives simpler and more enjoyable through technology.
